        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring IT professional currently completing a learnership in Business Analysis and IT Support Systems with Shaper (formerly Digital Academy). Passionate about technology, I enjoy working on projects that involve system design, user experience, and data analysis. I’ve developed strong skills in tools like Jira, Confluence, Microsoft Visio, and Tableau, and I’m particularly interested in how digital solutions can drive better decision-making and performance in businesses. Outside of work, I’m a team player who values collaboration, continuous learning, and making a positive impact through tech.</p>
